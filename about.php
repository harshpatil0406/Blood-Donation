    <h2>About Blood Donation</h2>
    <p>Blood from one donation can be divided into two components: red blood cells and plasma.<br>
    The average adult has about 10 pints of blood, but a typical wholeâ€‘blood donation is only 1 pint.
    Red blood cells have a short shelf life. They only last for six weeks (42 days).</p>
